# Agent Instructions

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` for full workflow context.

> **Architecture in one line:** Issues live in a local Dolt database
> (`.beads/dolt/`); cross-machine sync uses `bd dolt push/pull` (a
> git-compatible protocol), stored under `refs/dolt/data` on your git
> remote — separate from `refs/heads/*` where your code lives.
> `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export, not the wire protocol.
>
> See [SYNC_CONCEPTS.md](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md)
> for the one-screen overview and anti-patterns (don't treat JSONL as the
> source of truth; don't `bd import` during normal operation; don't
> reach for third-party Dolt hosting before trying the default).

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work atomically
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd dolt push          # Push beads data to remote
```

## Non-Interactive Shell Commands

**ALWAYS use non-interactive flags** with file operations to avoid hanging on confirmation prompts.

Shell commands like `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` may be aliased to include `-i` (interactive) mode on some systems, causing the agent to hang indefinitely waiting for y/n input.

**Use these forms instead:**
```bash
# Force overwrite without prompting
cp -f source dest           # NOT: cp source dest
mv -f source dest           # NOT: mv source dest
rm -f file                  # NOT: rm file

# For recursive operations
rm -rf directory            # NOT: rm -r directory
cp -rf source dest          # NOT: cp -r source dest
```

**Other commands that may prompt:**
- `scp` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` for non-interactive
- `ssh` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` to fail instead of prompting
- `apt-get` - use `-y` flag
- `brew` - use `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1` env var

## Issue tracking — beads (house rules)

This project uses **bd (beads)** as the work ledger. `bd prime` for commands; `bd ready` on arrival.

- **Beads is the work graph only** — tasks, bugs, dependencies, close-reasons. **Journal, state/sitrep, and memory files are the narrative and continuity layer and we use them heavily.** Beads never replaces them; a close-reason should point at the journal entry or commit that holds the story.
- Model decisions-needed-from-Trey as blocker beads (human-checkpoint-as-blocker-edge), so dependent work can't be picked up by mistake.
- Create the bead before starting substantial work; close with `--reason`.
- `bd remember` is welcome *alongside* memory files, not instead of them.
- Git behavior comes from this room's own rules (commits ungated, pushes gated — global CLAUDE.md), never from beads tooling.

Do not let `bd` tooling re-inject its managed CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md block; this section replaces it deliberately.
